	description = Sometimes, planets are on the opposite side of @/targetBody1 from us for several days.  To improve availability, we want you to put a relay in an orbit similar to @/homeworldParent's, but "ahead of" or "behind" it, so that the relay can see around @/targetBody1 and keep us connected.
