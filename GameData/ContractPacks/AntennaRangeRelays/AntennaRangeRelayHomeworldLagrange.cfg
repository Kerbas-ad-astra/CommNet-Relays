{
	name = AntennaRangeRelayHomeworldLagrange
	
	title = Place a relay satellite in orbit around @/targetBody1 ahead of or behind @/homeworld
	
	group = AntennaRangeRelays
	
	description = Sometimes, planets are on the opposite side of @/targetBody1 from us for several days.  To improve availability, we want you to put a relay in an orbit similar to @homeworld's, but "ahead of" or "behind" us, so that it can see around @/targetBody1 and keep us connected.
	
	synopsis = Place a communications relay in orbit ahead of or behind @/homeworld around @/targetBody1.
	
	completedMessage = The relay is in position.  Now @/targetBody1 won't get in our way!
