	description = To support later exploration missions to @/targetBody1, we want to establish a communication network of satellites with enough transmitter power to reach all the way back to @/homeworld.  This will allow later missions to use smaller, less power-hungry antennas.  For @/targetBody1, a Communotron 88-88 should do the trick.

	synopsis = Place a communications relay in orbit around @/targetBody1.
	
	completedMessage = The relay is in position.  Now later missions to @/targetBody1 can use it instead of having to transmit all the way to @/homeworld!
