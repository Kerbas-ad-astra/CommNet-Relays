CONTRACT_TYPE
{
	name = CommNetRelayHomeworldLagrange
	
	title = Place a relay satellite in orbit around @/targetBody1 ahead of or behind @/homeworld
	genericTitle = Place a relay satellite in orbit around our homeworld's parent ahead of or behind our homeworld
	
	group = CommNetRelays
	
	sortKey = 3
	
	description = Sometimes, planets are on the opposite side of @/targetBody1 from us for several days.  To improve availability, we want you to put a relay in an orbit similar to @homeworld's, but "ahead of" or "behind" us, so that it can see around @/targetBody1 and keep us connected.  Be sure to use lots of antennas, since it may have to reach all the way to the edge of the solar system.
